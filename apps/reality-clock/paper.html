<h1>Multi-Band Electromagnetic Ratio Analysis for Detection of<br>Variations in Fundamental Physical Constants</h1>

    <p>
        We propose a novel method for detecting variations in fundamental electromagnetic constants
        using multi-band radio frequency analysis on portable embedded hardware. By measuring the
        ratio of ambient electromagnetic properties across disparate frequency bands (125 kHz,
        13.56 MHz, and 300-928 MHz), we can establish baseline signatures that would shift detectably
        if the permittivity of free space (ε₀), permeability of free space (μ₀), or the speed of
        light (c) were to vary. This approach circumvents the self-reference problem inherent in
        absolute measurements by relying exclusively on dimensionless ratios. We present a practical
        implementation using the Flipper Zero platform as a proof-of-concept "Reality Dimension Clock."

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
The measurement of fundamental physical constants has traditionally required sophisticated
laboratory equipment and controlled environments. However, the question of whether such
constants might vary across different regions of spacetime—or hypothetically, across
different dimensional planes—presents unique challenges that laboratory measurement cannot address.
</p>

<p>
The central problem is one of <em>self-reference</em>: any measuring instrument is itself
constructed from matter whose properties depend on the very constants being measured. If the
fine structure constant α were to change, both the phenomenon being measured and the ruler
measuring it would be affected.
</p>

<p>
We propose that this limitation can be partially circumvented by measuring <em>ratios</em>
between different physical phenomena that depend on fundamental constants in different ways.
Specifically, we exploit the distinct physics governing near-field inductive coupling versus
far-field electromagnetic radiation.
</p>

<h2>2. Theoretical Framework</h2>

<h3>2.1 Fundamental Constants and Electromagnetic Behavior</h3>

<p>
The speed of light in vacuum is related to the permittivity and permeability of free space by:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    \[ c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_0 \mu_0}} \]
    <span class="equation-number">(1)</span>
</div>

<p>
The characteristic impedance of free space is given by:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    \[ Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\varepsilon_0}} \approx 377 \, \Omega \]
    <span class="equation-number">(2)</span>
</div>

<p>
The transition between near-field and far-field electromagnetic behavior occurs at a distance
proportional to the wavelength λ, which itself depends on frequency f and the speed of light:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    \[ \lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{1}{f\sqrt{\varepsilon_0 \mu_0}} \]
    <span class="equation-number">(3)</span>
</div>

<h3>2.2 Multi-Band Ratio Analysis</h3>

<p>
Consider three frequency bands with vastly different wavelengths:
</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Band</th>
            <th>Frequency</th>
            <th>Wavelength (λ)</th>
            <th>Dominant Coupling</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>LF (RFID)</td>
            <td>125 kHz</td>
            <td>2,400 m</td>
            <td>Near-field inductive</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>HF (NFC)</td>
            <td>13.56 MHz</td>
            <td>22.1 m</td>
            <td>Near-field inductive</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>UHF (Sub-GHz)</td>
            <td>433 MHz</td>
            <td>0.69 m</td>
            <td>Far-field radiative</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
The ratio of signal behavior between these bands should remain constant in a universe with
fixed electromagnetic constants. We define the <em>dimensional stability index</em> Φ as:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    \[ \Phi = \frac{R_{LF/HF}}{R_{HF/UHF}} = \frac{S_{LF}/S_{HF}}{S_{HF}/S_{UHF}} \]
    <span class="equation-number">(4)</span>
</div>

<p>
where S<sub>x</sub> represents the measured signal characteristic (RSSI, noise floor, or
coupling efficiency) at each frequency band. The value Φ should remain constant regardless
of environmental factors, as these affect all bands similarly.
</p>

<h3>2.3 Sensitivity to Constant Variations</h3>

<p>
If ε₀ or μ₀ were to change by a factor δ, the wavelength at each frequency would scale accordingly:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    \[ \lambda' = \frac{1}{f\sqrt{(\varepsilon_0 + \delta\varepsilon_0)(\mu_0 + \delta\mu_0)}} \]
    <span class="equation-number">(5)</span>
</div>

<p>
However, the near-field/far-field transition boundary would also shift, causing the UHF band
to experience different relative behavior compared to LF and HF bands. This differential
response is what makes Φ sensitive to variations in fundamental constants.
</p>

<h2>3. Implementation</h2>

<h3>3.1 Hardware Platform</h3>

<p>
We implement the measurement system on the Flipper Zero, a portable multi-tool device
containing the following relevant subsystems:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>CC1101</strong> — Sub-GHz transceiver (300-928 MHz) with RSSI measurement</li>
    <li><strong>ST25R3916</strong> — NFC controller (13.56 MHz) with field strength detection</li>
    <li><strong>Analog frontend</strong> — 125 kHz RFID with carrier detection</li>
    <li><strong>Crystal oscillator</strong> — 32.768 kHz reference clock</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.2 Measurement Protocol</h3>

<p>
The device periodically samples all three RF subsystems and computes the dimensional
stability index. A baseline calibration is performed in the "home" reference frame,
and subsequent measurements are compared against this baseline.

</div>

<h3>3.3 Anomaly Detection</h3>

<p>
The baseline match percentage B is computed as:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    \[ B = 100 \times \left(1 - \frac{|\Phi_{measured} - \Phi_{baseline}|}{\Phi_{baseline}}\right) \]
    <span class="equation-number">(6)</span>
</div>

<p>
Values of B significantly below 100% indicate a detectable shift in the ratios, suggesting
a variation in the underlying physical constants.
</p>

<h2>4. Discussion</h2>

<h3>4.1 Limitations</h3>

<p>
Several factors may introduce noise into the measurements:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Environmental RF interference varying by band</li>
    <li>Temperature effects on crystal oscillator and antenna resonance</li>
    <li>Orientation-dependent antenna coupling</li>
    <li>Hardware component tolerances</li>
</ul>

<p>
These can be partially mitigated through temporal averaging, statistical filtering, and
multi-sample calibration protocols.
</p>

<h3>4.2 Theoretical Considerations</h3>

<p>
It should be noted that if fundamental constants change, the device's own components—being
constructed of ordinary matter—would also be affected. However, the <em>differential</em>
response across frequency bands provides a window of detectability, as the ratio of
near-field to far-field behavior depends on constants in a non-linear fashion.
</p>

<p>
The fine structure constant α, which governs electromagnetic interaction strength, is given by:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    \[ \alpha = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0\hbar c} \approx \frac{1}{137} \]
    <span class="equation-number">(7)</span>
</div>

<p>
Changes in α would affect atomic structure (and hence the device itself), but the
electromagnetic ratio Φ provides a complementary measurement that may reveal such changes
before catastrophic hardware failure occurs.
</p>

<h2>5. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
We have presented a theoretical framework and practical implementation for detecting
variations in fundamental electromagnetic constants using portable multi-band RF hardware.
While the method cannot provide absolute measurements of constants, the dimensionless
ratio approach offers a novel pathway for detecting <em>relative</em> variations that would
be invisible to conventional single-band instruments.
</p>

<p>
Future work will include extensive baseline calibration across multiple environments,
statistical analysis of measurement stability, and correlation studies with other potential
indicators of dimensional or spacetime variation.
</p>

<h2>6. Testing Scenarios and Falsifiability</h2>

<p>
For any scientific instrument to be valid, it must be testable and falsifiable. We present
several hypothetical scenarios to evaluate the Reality Dimension Clock's expected behavior,
along with potential failure modes that could produce false readings.
</p>

<h3>6.1 Scenario A: Relativistic Velocity Approach</h3>

<p>
Consider an observer carrying the device while approaching relativistic velocities (v → c).
According to special relativity, the measured speed of light remains constant in all inertial
reference frames. However, other effects would manifest:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    \[ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \]
    <span class="equation-number">(8)</span>
</div>

<p>
<strong>Expected behavior:</strong> The device should show <em>no change</em> in Φ. The fundamental
constants ε₀, μ₀, and c do not vary with velocity—this is a cornerstone of relativity.
What does change is the <em>observed</em> frequency of external signals (Doppler shift) and
time dilation effects on the crystal oscillator relative to an external observer.
</p>

<p>
However, from the device's own reference frame, all internal ratios remain constant.
The Reality Dimension Clock measures ratios between its own subsystems, all of which
experience identical relativistic effects. <strong>Prediction: Φ remains at baseline.</strong>
</p>

<p>
If Φ were to change during relativistic travel, this would suggest either:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A violation of special relativity (extraordinary claim requiring extraordinary evidence)</li>
    <li>Hardware malfunction due to acceleration stress</li>
    <li>Interaction with external EM fields Doppler-shifted into measurement bands</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.2 Scenario B: Alternate Dimensional Plane</h3>

<p>
Consider the hypothetical scenario where an observer transitions to an alternate dimension
occupying the same spatial coordinates but with modified fundamental constants. We distinguish
two sub-cases:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Case B1: Constants differ by small perturbation (δ &lt; 1%)</strong>
</p>

<p>
If ε₀ or μ₀ differ by a small amount, the device would likely still function. The wavelength
ratios would shift according to:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    \[ \frac{\lambda'_{UHF}}{\lambda'_{LF}} = \frac{\lambda_{UHF}}{\lambda_{LF}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\varepsilon_0 \mu_0}}{\sqrt{\varepsilon'_0 \mu'_0}} \]
    <span class="equation-number">(9)</span>
</div>

<p>
The near-field to far-field transition boundary scales with wavelength. Since UHF operates
in the far-field regime while LF/HF operate in the near-field, their coupling efficiencies
would scale differently. <strong>Prediction: Φ would deviate from baseline, magnitude proportional
to δ.</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Case B2: Constants differ substantially (δ &gt; 10%)</strong>
</p>

<p>
Large variations in electromagnetic constants would fundamentally alter atomic structure.
The Bohr radius scales as:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    \[ a_0 = \frac{4\pi\varepsilon_0\hbar^2}{m_e e^2} \]
    <span class="equation-number">(10)</span>
</div>

<p>
Significant changes to ε₀ would alter bond lengths in silicon, copper, and all materials
comprising the device. The crystal oscillator frequency, antenna dimensions, and semiconductor
behavior would all shift. <strong>Prediction: Device may malfunction entirely, or produce
readings so anomalous that dimensional transition is unambiguous.</strong>
</p>

<h3>6.3 Scenario C: Gradual Dimensional Drift</h3>

<p>
If dimensional boundaries are not sharp but represent gradual transitions, the device should
record a continuous drift in Φ as the observer moves through the transition zone. This would
manifest as:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    \[ \Phi(t) = \Phi_0 + \int_0^t \frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial x} \cdot v(t') \, dt' \]
    <span class="equation-number">(11)</span>
</div>

<p>
where x represents position along the dimensional gradient. <strong>Prediction: Smooth,
monotonic deviation from baseline during transition, stabilizing at new value in target dimension.</strong>
</p>

<h2>7. Falsification Criteria and Edge Cases</h2>

<p>
To maintain scientific rigor, we must identify conditions under which the device would
produce readings indistinguishable from genuine dimensional variation. These represent
potential "bugs" in our methodology.
</p>

<h3>7.2 Hardware Failure Modes</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Component aging:</strong> Gradual drift in oscillator frequency or antenna resonance over months/years. Requires periodic recalibration.</li>
    <li><strong>Battery voltage sag:</strong> Low battery affects RF amplifier gain differently across bands. Monitor battery level.</li>
    <li><strong>Physical damage:</strong> Cracked antenna, loose connector. Sudden discontinuous jump in readings.</li>
    <li><strong>Firmware bug:</strong> Incorrect RSSI calculation or sampling timing. Validate against known RF sources.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7.3 Distinguishing True Positives from False Positives</h3>

<p>
A genuine dimensional shift should exhibit the following characteristics that distinguish it
from environmental or hardware artifacts:
</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> Environmental effects are typically transient. A true dimensional shift should produce stable, sustained deviation.</li>
    <li><strong>Consistency across frequencies:</strong> Environmental interference typically affects narrow bands. Dimensional constant changes would shift all ratios systematically.</li>
    <li><strong>Independence from orientation:</strong> Moving or rotating the device should not significantly alter a true dimensional signal.</li>
    <li><strong>Correlation with subjective experience:</strong> If the observer reports dimensional transition, the device reading should correlate temporally.</li>
    <li><strong>Return to baseline:</strong> Upon returning to the home dimension, readings should return to original calibration values.</li>
</ol>

<h3>7.4 The Null Hypothesis</h3>

<p>
The scientific null hypothesis is that <em>no dimensional variation exists</em>, and all
deviations in Φ are attributable to known physical effects or measurement error. To reject
this null hypothesis, we would require:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Statistically significant deviation (p &lt; 0.01) from baseline</li>
    <li>Exclusion of all environmental factors listed in Section 7.1</li>
    <li>Reproducibility across multiple devices</li>
    <li>Correlation with independent measurement methods (if available)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Failure to meet these criteria means the reading should be attributed to mundane causes,
regardless of subjective experience.
</p>

<h2>8. Experimental Protocol</h2>

<p>
We propose the following testing protocol for validating the Reality Dimension Clock:
</p>

<h3>8.1 Baseline Establishment</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Perform 1000 measurements over 24-hour period in home location</li>
    <li>Calculate mean and standard deviation of Φ</li>
    <li>Establish "normal range" as μ ± 3σ</li>
    <li>Repeat in multiple known locations to establish environmental variance</li>
</ol>

<h3>8.2 Controlled Interference Testing</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Expose device to known RF sources at each band</li>
    <li>Test in Faraday cage at various attenuation levels</li>
    <li>Temperature cycling from -10°C to +50°C</li>
    <li>Document all false positive conditions</li>
</ol>

<h3>8.3 Field Testing</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Carry device during reported dimensional transition events</li>
    <li>Log readings with timestamps</li>
    <li>Correlate with subjective experience journal</li>
    <li>Analyze for patterns distinguishable from noise</li>
</ol>
